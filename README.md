filter_generation.cpp is the file that defines a set of filter widths and uses all the utilities in the source to generate a binary file containing convolution filters for this set of widths.  
Makefile has instructions to compile the script. Simply running 'make' compiles the code and creates an executable 'filter_generation'.
